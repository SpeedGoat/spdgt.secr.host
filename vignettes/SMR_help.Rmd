# Spatial Mark-Resight Model Options in R
## Using the `mcmc_SMR` Function

### Introduction
The `mcmc_SMR` function implements a spatial mark-resight model that combines marking and resighting data to estimate population parameters. This document outlines the various options and configurations available based on your data structure and research needs.

### 1. Activity Center Configuration
Control how animal movement is modeled between marking and sighting phases:
```r
input = list(act_center = "move" | "no move")
```
* `"move"`: Allows activity centers to relocate between marking and sighting phases
* `"no move"`: Assumes static activity centers
  * Best for short study periods
  * Recommended for sparse data
  * More computationally efficient

### 2. Observation Models
Configure how detections are modeled in both marking and sighting processes:
```r
input = list(obstype = c("bernoulli", "poisson"))
```

Available combinations:
| Marking Process | Sighting Process | Use Case |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| bernoulli | bernoulli | Binary detection in both phases |
| bernoulli | poisson | Binary marking, count-based sightings |
| poisson | bernoulli | Count-based marking, binary sightings |
| poisson | poisson | Count-based for both processes |

### 3. Identity Update Methods
Specify how individual identities are updated in the MCMC process:
```r
input = list(IDup = "Gibbs" | "MH")
```
* `"Gibbs"`: Available only for Poisson observation models
* `"MH"`: Required for Bernoulli observation models (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm)

### 4. Data Structure Options

#### Required Data Components
```r
data = list(
    y_mark = array(),           # Marking capture histories
    y_sight_marked = array(),   # Sighting histories for marked animals
    y_sight_unmarked = array(), # Sighting histories for unmarked animals
    X1 = matrix(),              # Marking location coordinates
    X2 = matrix(),              # Sighting location coordinates
    G_marked = matrix(),        # Genetic/categorical data for marked animals
    G_unmarked = matrix()       # Genetic/categorical data for unmarked animals
)
```

#### Optional Data Components
```r
data = list(
    # Telemetry Data
    locs = array(),  # Telemetry locations for marked individuals
    
    # Additional Sighting Types
    y_sight_unk = array(),         # Sightings of unknown marked status
    y_sight_marked_noID = array(), # Sightings of marked but unidentified individuals
    
    # Study Area Definition (choose one)
    buff = numeric(),              # Buffer distance around trap locations
    vertices = matrix(),           # Explicit polygon vertices of study area
    
    # Trap Operation Information
    tf1 = matrix(),               # Trap operation times for marking process
    tf2 = matrix(),               # Trap operation times for sighting process
    markedS = matrix()            # Marking status by occasion
)
```

### 5. Storage Configuration
Control which model components are stored during MCMC:
```r
input = list(
    storeLatent = TRUE | FALSE,  # Store individual identities and locations
    storeGamma = TRUE | FALSE    # Store categorical covariate probabilities
)
```

### 6. Process Types

#### Complete Identity Information
* Standard scenario with:
  * Known marked individuals
  * Unmarked individuals
  * Basic spatial capture-recapture

#### Partial Identity Information
* Handles uncertainty in:
  * Unknown marked status
  * Marked but unidentified individuals
  * Genetic/categorical markers

#### Additional Data Integration
* Flexibility to include:
  * Telemetry data
  * Variable trap operation times
  * Different study area definitions

### 7. Population Size Estimation
Configure data augmentation for population size estimation:
```r
input = list(
    M = 200  # Number of potential individuals in population
)
```
* Adjustable based on expected population size
* Enables estimation through data augmentation

### 8. MCMC Settings
Control the Markov Chain Monte Carlo process:
```r
input = list(
    niter = 2400,   # Total iterations
    nburn = 1200,   # Burn-in period
    nthin = 5       # Thinning interval
)
```

### Example Usage

```r
# Basic model with static activity centers
result <- mcmc_SMR(
    data = list(
        y_mark = marking_data,
        y_sight_marked = sighting_marked,
        y_sight_unmarked = sighting_unmarked,
        X1 = mark_coords,
        X2 = sight_coords,
        G_marked = genetic_marked,
        G_unmarked = genetic_unmarked,
        buff = 1000  # 1km buffer
    ),
    input = list(
        act_center = "no move",
        obstype = c("bernoulli", "poisson"),
        IDup = "MH",
        M = 200,
        niter = 2400,
        nburn = 1200,
        nthin = 5
    )
)
```
